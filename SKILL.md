# Global Company Person Colleague Query

Query colleague data from the global company database (全球企业库) using the UpKuaJing Open Platform API.

## Overview

This skill provides access to colleague information from UpKuaJing's global company database. Given a company ID (pid) and a person ID (hid), it returns the list of colleagues with their person IDs and job titles. Supports cursor-based pagination for large result sets.

**Prerequisite**: Both the company ID (pid) and person ID (hid) are required as input. If the user does not already have them, use the **global-company-person-search** skill first to search for the target person and obtain their pid and hid, then proceed with this skill.

## Running Scripts

### Environment Setup

1. **Check Python**: `python --version`
2. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Script directory: `scripts/*.py`
Run example: `python scripts/*.py`

**Important**: Always use direct script invocation like `python scripts/person_colleague_list.py`. **Do NOT use** shell compound commands like `cd scripts && python person_colleague_list.py`

### Colleague List Query (`person_colleague_list.py`)
- **Return granularity**: Each colleague as one record
- **Use cases**: Find colleagues of a specific person at a company
- **Examples**:
  - "Find colleagues of person H_67890 at company US_12345"
  - "Get more colleagues using the next page cursor"
- **Parameters**: See [Colleague List API](references/person-colleague-list-api.md)

## API Key and Top-up

This skill requires an API key. The API key is stored in the `~/.upkuajing/.env` file:
```bash
cat ~/.upkuajing/.env
```
**Example file content**:
```
UPKUAJING_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
### **API Key Not Set**
First check if the `~/.upkuajing/.env` file has UPKUAJING_API_KEY;
If UPKUAJING_API_KEY is not set, prompt the user to choose:
1. User has one: User provides it (manually add to ~/.upkuajing/.env file)
2. User doesn't have one: You can apply using the interface (`auth.py --new_key`), the new key will be automatically saved to ~/.upkuajing/.env
Wait for user selection;

### **Account Top-up**
When API response indicates insufficient balance, explain and guide user to top up:
1. Create top-up order (`auth.py --new_rec_order`)
2. Based on order response, send payment page URL to user, guide user to open URL and pay, user confirms after successful payment;

### **Get Account Information**
Use this script to get account information for UPKUAJING_API_KEY: `auth.py --account_info`

## API Key and UpKuaJing Account
- Newly applied API key: Register and login at [UpKuaJing Open Platform](https://developer.upkuajing.com/), then bind account

## Fees

**All API calls incur fees**, different interfaces have different billing methods.

**Latest pricing**: Users can visit [Detailed Price Description](https://www.upkuajing.com/web/openapi/price.html)
Or use: `python scripts/auth.py --price_info` (returns complete pricing for all interfaces)

### Query Billing Rules

Billed by **number of calls**, each call returns one page of colleague records:
- Each API call incurs a fee
- Use `--cursor` to get additional pages (each page is a separate call)
- **Before execution:**
  1. Inform user that this query will incur a fee
  2. Stop, wait for explicit user confirmation in a separate message, then execute script

### Fee Confirmation Principle

**Any operation that incurs fees must first inform and wait for explicit user confirmation. Do not execute in the same message as the notification.**

## Workflow

### Decision Guide

| User Intent | Use API |
|-------------|---------|
| "Find colleagues of person H_67890 at company US_12345" | Colleague List Query |
| User has a person/company name but no pid/hid | global-company-person-search (find the person and get pid/hid, then use this skill) |

## Usage Examples

### Query Colleague List

**User request**: "Find colleagues of person H_67890 at company US_12345"
```bash
python scripts/person_colleague_list.py --pid US_12345 --hid H_67890
```

**Get next page** (use cursor returned from previous response):
```bash
python scripts/person_colleague_list.py --pid US_12345 --hid H_67890 --cursor 'cursor_string_from_previous_response'
```

## Error Handling

- **API key invalid/non-existent**: Check `UPKUAJING_API_KEY` in `~/.upkuajing/.env` file
- **Insufficient balance**: Guide user to top up
- **Invalid parameters**: **Must first check the corresponding API documentation in references/ directory**, get correct parameter names and formats from documentation, do not guess

### API Documentation Reference

- Colleague List: Check [references/person-colleague-list-api.md](references/person-colleague-list-api.md)

## Best Practices

1. **Check API documentation**:
   - **Before executing queries, must first check the corresponding API reference documentation**
   - Check [references/person-colleague-list-api.md](references/person-colleague-list-api.md)
   - Do not guess parameter names, get accurate parameter names and formats from documentation

2. **Query parameters**:
   - Both the company ID (pid) and person ID (hid) are required. If the user provides a person/company name instead, first use **global-company-person-search** to find the target person and obtain their pid and hid.

3. **Pagination**:
   - When the response returns a non-empty `cursor`, more data is available
   - Pass the `cursor` value to get the next page
   - An empty `cursor` means there is no more data

## Notes
- Colleague records use `hid` as the person unique identifier; `pid` is the company identifier
- `titleNames` is a list of job title strings for each colleague
- File paths use forward slashes on all platforms
- **Prohibit outputting technical parameter format**: Do not display code-style parameters in responses, convert to natural language
- **Do not** estimate or guess per-call fees — use `python scripts/auth.py --price_info` to get accurate pricing information
- **Do not** guess parameter names, get accurate parameter names and formats from documentation
